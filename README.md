  <h1 id='quote-generator'>Vanilla Js: Quote Generator</h1>
  <h5> 
    What is it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Another pure javascript application that makes use of APIs, promises and JSON
    </p>
    <h5> 
    How was it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    It was fun working with APIs, though the quotes werenâ€™t impactful enough for me
    </p>
    <h5> 
     Future steps
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Perhaps I could create my own API with quotes more suited to me and make it publicly available
    </p>
